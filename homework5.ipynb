        "Over an extended period, such as 10,000 days, a noticeable trend emerges: the probabilities of different outcomes tend to remain consistent. This observation suggests that the distribution has reached a stable state. Strikingly, the probabilities after 10,000 days closely resemble those after only 15 days. As the number of days increases, the probability values for each state gradually converge. Notably, when the number of trials is small, the model tends to assign disproportionately high odds to the \"rest\" and \"sweets\" categories. However, as the number of trials rises, the probabilities settle at approximately 13.76% for \"rest,\" 23.85% for \"sweets,\" and 62.39% for \"exercises.\""
